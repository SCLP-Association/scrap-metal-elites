What an entrance!

Check out this loadout!

They enter the arena with confidence!

You can really see the science at play here.

First contact, and what a hit!

Powerful attack!

Couldn't quite line it up.

They're lining up for a new attack.

Look like they're giving chase!

Now the battle is really on!

Look at these moves!

Ouch, that's gotta hurt.

No! Catastrophic damage!

And another competitor is taken out!

They must have hurt!

Swings around...

Gaming momentum!

A quick direction change...

Nice dodge!

The attack was deflected.

They've got em trapped in a corner!

They're up against the ropes!

Looks like they're about the fall apart!

All the meyhem!

So much carnage!

BOOM!

Ooooh, that looked painful!

Years of engineering up in smoke!

Those sesors appear to be malfuntioning!

Something's gone wrong with their wheels!

Wow! What a match!

If tomorrow's event is anything like this one, it promises to be a blast!

I really enjoyed tonight's show, and the crowd obviously loved it.

On behalf of my co-host that's it for tonight. Thank you for watching.

Tune in tomorrow for another exciting evening of Scrap Metal Elites!
